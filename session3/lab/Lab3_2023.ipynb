    "In some situations, data labeling can be pretty expensive, although it is available in large quantity. This can occur when human expertise is required, or when particular resources are needed to determine the label, among other examples. In these cases, one can be interested in what is commonly called *semi-supervised learning*. This paradigm is halfway between supervised and unsupervised learning, and typically consists in attributing labels to unlabeled samples, given a low count of labeled samples of the same classes. Semi-supervised learning can be used to provide a pseudo-label to the unlabeled samples, but also to get better performance than unsupervised learning. Indeed, knowledge of a few labels gives some information that can be exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to perform semi-supervised clustering is to use a *nearest class mean* (NCM) classifier. Such a classifier computes a barycenter of the labeled samples of a particular class. Then, unsupervised samples are attributed the label of the closest barycenter. Those barycenters can be computed either directly as a mean of the values of all labeled samples per feature, or on a transformed representation of the samples. Such a transformation can be obtained for instance in the middle layer of an autoencoder.\n",
